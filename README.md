1. API Development:

Start by creating a FastAPI app with a POST endpoint /analyze.
Define a Pydantic model for the input JSON containing the text field.
Create a function to handle the analysis of the text and return the result.

2. Model Integration:

Use the transformers library to load a pre-trained sentiment analysis model.
Ensure efficient model loading, possibly using FastAPI's startup events.
Write a function to perform text classification using the loaded model.

3. Containerization:

Write a Dockerfile to containerize your FastAPI application.
Specify dependencies, copy relevant files, and expose the necessary port.
Build the Docker image and run it locally to ensure everything works as expected.

4. Testing:

Write test cases using FastAPI’s TestClient to ensure the API behaves correctly.
Test sending positive, negative, and possibly neutral sentiment texts.
Verify that the API returns the expected results for each case.

5. Deployment:

Deploy the Docker container on Hugging Face Spaces.
Make sure the endpoint is publicly accessible and functional.

6. Documentation:

Utilize FastAPI’s automatic documentation features to document your API.
Include instructions on how to build and run the Docker container in the README file.
Provide clear guidelines on how to interact with the API, including sample requests and responses.
